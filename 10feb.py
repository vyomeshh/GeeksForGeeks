'''Koko is given an array arr[], where each element represents a pile of bananas. She has exactly k hours to eat all the bananas.

Each hour, Koko can choose one pile and eat up to s bananas from it.

If the pile has atleast s bananas, she eats exactly s bananas.
If the pile has fewer than s bananas, she eats the entire pile in that hour.

Koko can only eat from one pile per hour.


Your task is to find the minimum value of s (bananas per hour) such that Koko can finish all the piles within k hours.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [5, 10, 3], k = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: If Koko eats at the rate of 5 bananas per hour:
First pile of 5 bananas will be finished in 1 hour.
Second pile of 10 bananas will be finished in 2 hours.
Third pile of 3 bananas will be finished in 1 hours.
Therefore, Koko can finish all piles of bananas in 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 hours.
Input: arr[] = [5, 10, 15, 20], k = 7
Output: 10
Explanation: If Koko eats at the rate of 10 bananas per hour, it will take 6 hours to finish all the piles.
Constraint:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ k ≤ 106
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 106'''

class Solution:
    def kokoEat(self, arr, k):
        # Range of possible eating rates
        low = 1
        high = max(arr)
        ans = high
        
        while low <= high:
            mid = low + (high - low) // 2
            
            # Calculate total hours needed at rate 'mid'
            total_hours = 0
            for pile in arr:
                # This is equivalent to math.ceil(pile / mid)
                total_hours += (pile + mid - 1) // mid
            
            if total_hours <= k:
                # Current rate is fast enough, record it and try smaller
                ans = mid
                high = mid - 1
            else:
                # Too slow, need to eat faster
                low = mid + 1
                
        return ans
